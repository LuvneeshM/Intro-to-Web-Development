	The article brought up a few good points that I did not honestly consider to be a part of the designing process. Normally, I am the kind of person who plans as they go and adds things on as they come to me. However, for designing a wireframe, work ethic as such would only further hinder the process. For example, every time I would want to add some extra aspect, I would have to run it by my team and the client. Therefore, as suggested in the article it is best to first take the time and have thorough sketches, since taking the time to sketch will allow the opportunity to talk it through with the stakeholders. Also, another suggestion made was to not only get feedback, but also to get it early. It is better to get feedback and thoughts early because if the client does not like the way you did something and used the same technique/way throughout the rest of the product, than a huge amount if not all your work would be for waste. In addition, the feedback is a good way to ensure you keep on track and properly designed the product for the right audience.
